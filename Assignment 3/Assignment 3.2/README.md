# Second Iteration

I experimented a bit more with variations in the features, and cluster numbers.
I visualized the formed clusters and showed them to a friend (who is a museum curator) for a second opinion 
as I found that I was happy with how they were paired visually for this final submission, despite a couple
artworks in each cluster that felt irrelevant. My friend agreed with me, so I guess I could consider that
a success!

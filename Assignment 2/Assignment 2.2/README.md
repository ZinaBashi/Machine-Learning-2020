# Second Iteration

After trying a variety of image transformations, including thresholding and skeletonizing, censure, and daisy, I came to the conclusion that using HOG was the best option, and gave me the best results.
I'm still tweaking with the parameters of both the hog method as well as the neural network algorithm, but I think (hope) I've made decent progress so far.

I'd like to see how it works on Aaron's test set to ensure that I am in fact making progress on the generalizability of my model.

Stormie’s behavior is similar to that of neo-Nazis who cover up for the National Socialist German Workers’ Party. http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html Stormie's name (and Stormie’s behavior) probably makes people think of “stormtrooper.” But that point would never cross the mind of Stormie's dim-witted cohorts. In similar stormtrooper imitation, wikilings ban people who post accurate information exposing neo-nazi activity.  They delete anything, including even links, to accurate information. They delete accurate information that is posted on “discussion” pages, which are supposedly for discussion, but are not. Discussion pages are where wikilings insult people and then delete responses to the insults. Wikipedia is a completely untrustworthy source of information because it enables wikiling administrators to delete accurate information, but also to ban people who post accurate information, in order to prevent accurate information from being re-posted.\n",

I don't suppose this is much different from standard Wikipedia lies about the Soviet Union, Venezuela, Iraq or so forth, but I'll correct it anyway.  I know most of Wikipedia is a bunch of half-baked lies and propaganda of this type, but once in a while people will read this and realize this is just another lie and distortion on Wikipedia in the service of a certain cause.

When you say \"\"the supposed spirit of the \"\"new Northern Ireland\"\" you seem to be essentially claiming that the new Northern Ireland is more a part of the Republic of Ireland than in was before. The reality is that NI is now less part of the UK, and less part of the ROI. As I write, the episode of 'Coast' on Northern Ireland is on TV, and it is just reminding me of how the NI article is Wikipedia's most shamefully negligent article: something I proved with examples over a year ago. It is bereft of locality and positivity. The more recent generations in NI expect a country to grow up in, not an abstract story, or a 'nowhere place' - they have one in every needed sense, except the minds of those who need to put their on need and idea of nationalism first.   \n",

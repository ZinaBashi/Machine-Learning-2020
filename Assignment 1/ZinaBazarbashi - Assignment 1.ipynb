The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.\n",

Also, we are not talking about \"\"board of directors of websites\"\". A website need not necessarily have a \"\"board of directors\"\". Even you can create your own website without the need for officers. We are talking about this spurious Philippine Web Awards being completely anonymous, in contrast with authentic award-giving bodies who would always devulge their leadership to the public. The mention of the board of directors of the Nobel Prize was just meant to support this. Your problem is you are always confused about what is being discussed. If you don't have the capacity to understand simple logic then how can you edit an encyclopedia? No wonder 99% of all your edits are being reverted by other editors, and that up to now you are still uploading illegal images to Wikipedia.

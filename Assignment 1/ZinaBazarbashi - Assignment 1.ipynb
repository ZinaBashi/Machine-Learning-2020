Keith Devlin wrote \"\"since the complex numbers are not points on a line, you cannot say which of two complex numbers is the larger; for the complex numbers there is no such notion.\"\" Yet he also stated \"\"There is, however, a notion of size of sorts.  The absolute value of a complex number a + bi is the distance from the origin to the number.\"\" [Devlin, Keith, The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible Macmillan, 2000: 133.} Desmond Fearnley-Sander explains that \"\"From a geometric point of viuew, complex numbers are not points but ratios of vectors.\"\" [Fearnley-Sander, Desmond, Plane Euclidean Reasoning, in Automated Deduction in Geometry, 2nd International Workshop, ed.

Riemann's wanted to prove Euler's conjecture, which he attacked by solving complex solutions to f(zeta) = 0.  Riemann found x + iy, where x lies between 0 and 1, has infinitely many solutions.  He proposed they all (except negative even integers) are of form 1/2 + iy.  Computer tests find the first 1.5 billion f(z) = 0 (called z(s)) solutions lie on the line x = 1/2 in the complex plane.  But inductive evidence does not mathematically prove anything, and the Riemann hypothesis remains perhaps the most important unsolved problem of our era.\n",

      "Now a Financial Times investigation has established that these groups receive extensive funding from Indians abroad, collected mainly as tax-free charity donations to front organisations in the US and the UK. This fundraising is coming under increasing scrutiny. So it should - as should the links between these groups and India's ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP).\n",
      "\n",
      "Behind the VHP and the Bajrang Dal stands a quasi-paramilitary body, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS or Association of National Volunteers), which is the mother organisation of the Hindu revivalist BJP. Described by Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, as \"\"an Indian version of fascism\"\", the RSS is at the centre of a protean network of front organisations. This structure facilitates arm's-length money-raising. It also makes it easier for the RSS to deny it is inciting agitation against Muslims and Christians.....................................The RSS spends heavily on welfare and religious schools, but so do Islamist groups in the Muslim world - a danger the world has woken up to. Such ostensibly charitable activities are one reason for the groups' success. They also help pull in donations from people unaware of how some of their money is used.\n",
      "\n",
      "The UK is formally investigating two RSS fundraising affiliates, and is considering an inquiry into the VHP. The US has also started carefully scrutinising RSS front organisations. That probe should go ahead unimpeded by Washington's ambition to develop a strategic alliance with India as a counterbalance to China's weight in Asia.\n",

      "It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.\n",
      "\n",
      "It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it had be\n",

      "\":Ali, as I've wrote, none of those authors are aware of many important details, such as Kurekchay Treaty - an official and legal treaty which defined the entry of Karabakh into Russian empire. At the same time, the khan of Sheki too signed a similar treaty, for example. I know Michael Croissant, and his book is full of mistakes and errors, his book doesn't mean much in this regard. His mistakes are too gross  the Russo-Iran war started in 1806, whilst Karabakh became part of Russia in 1805 before such a war. Meanwhile, Tim Potier is a good legal expert, and it is surprizing to see him write that. But everyone is entitled to errors and his was due to lack of resources - he was limited as a scholar in variety of materials and legal status of Karabakh in 19th century was not his objective  the 20th century was. Anyways, I do not know the khans of Iran in the south and which treaties they concluded with British. If they did it in the Zand period, they probably had full legal right at the time, since Iran was more of a geographic entity, than political. Same with Azerbaijan (North) - it was geographic too. Whilst I do not remember the legal documents and letters of the time, the later Russian and British documents clearly identified Azerbaijanis of the North as \"\"aderbeijani tatars\"\" - I have evidence of that as far back as 1880 in British census estimates and in the 1897 official Russian Imperial Census. Same word is used by Russian ethnographer Velichko in his 1903 book. Azerbaijani author, Firudin bey Kocharly wrote a book in 1908 \"\"Literature of Azerbaijani Turks\"\". \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, Azerbaijanis simultaneously fought against both Iran and Russia at the time, and some sided with either one side or another. Unfortunately, you won't find much on that in libraries - but just one such translated book would allow scholars to reconsider mistaken assumptions. What is more important however, is that Karabakh khan (khan being a Turkic term derived from kagan), was that it concluded its own treaty, that it minted its own money (one of the typical examples of independence), and fought several wars with Iran, some handily winning, others, like 1797, ambgiously  but still Shah Muhammed Qajar gets killed. And I don't know who told you about Vagif and Ibrahim  by the later you probably mean Ibrahim khan, right? Well, Vagif, the poet and vizier, was executed in 1797, AFTER shah's death, and was executed by the temporary ruler, Mamed bey Jevanshir, who was nephew of Ibrahim khan. While details are murky and contradictory, the Qajars didn't have the primary rolse in this  indeed, once shah was killed, Iranian troops withdrew, it screwed up all the plans to re-conquering other parts of Azerbaijan and Georgia. Meanwhile, Ibrahim khan lived and ruled the khanate until tragic error - or so it is explained  in 1806. But anyway, the Kurekchay Treaty was signed by him. Thus, once more, Karabakh khanate, for one, was totally independent, and Iran had no legitimate or otherwise claims whatsoever to it. Meanwhile, few other khanates were nominally dependent - like Poland was to USSR, or Armenia to Russia (Russian speaker of Parliament, #3 person in the country, openly called it \"\"forepost of Russia\"\" whilst in Armenia).  \n",

This is because what is inside the parenthesis needs to get evaluated first. In this case it would be 10^(1 followed by 100 zeroes). By using a little bit of mathematical induction you can conclude that it has a googol amount of zeroes. For instance, 10^7 has 7 zeroes, 10^10000 has 10000 zeroes, and therefore 10^(10^100) has 10^100 (googol amount of zeroes). But it seems like the article doesn't put the parenthesis.\n",

She also created common things such as the coffee cup, pillow, and the sink. The product went into stores in 1961. It was sold at stores like Walmart, CVS, Wallgreens, and Pharmacies all over the world. It was originally called \"\"Fire in the Water\"\" then they started calling it what it truly is \"\"Liquid Water\"\". Liquid water sold for $10.00 per box. Each box contains 7 15x10 jars full of Liquid Fire. Daria Huerta created the Cark. She was playing around with genes from a shark and a cat one day. A year later she created a mutated creature. It was half shark, half cat. She then released it into the wild in 1990. The Cark started destroying the whole ecosystem. They had to destroy the Cark which took about 5 years. In 1995 she then decided it was time for her to quit science so she became a seamstress. She was playing around with yarn and discovered a thin piece that had ripped off which she then used to clean her teeth. This was called floss. In 2000 she created flavors like spearmint, peppermint, and wintermint. Huerta died in 2001.\n",

The results from the Quick Count, which were made public some days later, showed that the statistical tests showed Calderon as winning in all three, but in two of them the difference was within the margin of error and in the third it was only barely outside. It was because of this, as per prior agreement, that the IFE declared the race too close to call (the prior agreement was that the IFE would either state which candidate was projected to be the winner based on the Conteo Rapido, or ask for a couple more hours to collate more results, or declare the race too close to call). The Quick Count was not the PREP. As it happens, the final tally agreed with the Quick Count results.\n",

However, Kosovo is nowhere treated as an entity indistinct from Serbia (and most definatly not indistinct from the S-M), as no faction in the world sees it that way. I suggest that a possible compromise is that we should add that the Kosovar Albanian goverment refuses the Belgrade suzeiranity and considers it not a part of Serbia, and then the other side of the story (Serbia & the world), however, pointing it not an official part of Serbia and Montenegro is, francly, I apologize for the expression, but it is, really nonsensical.

I feel very strongly about music genres and do take into consideration what kind of instrumentation and style a song uses and I thin the people who add genres to articles are rather lax about it!\n",
      "P.S. even though i shouldn't compliment you I have to say I found the Genre Warrior article very funny, very satiric!\n",

It's at epidemic proportions and I decided I had to get some attention for it... Review my edits, keeping in mind that the couple dozen edits involved in the creation, polishing and sustaining of entire articles (like my first, Whitechapel) is worth several hundreds, or even thousands, of janitorial edits.

      "\n",
      "I recall Hurricanes Bonnie and Charley hitting Florida within a day of each other, and both of them passing off the Jersey Shore a few days later.  It was the remnants of Charley, not Bonnie, which brought the heaviest rain to the Jersey Shore on August 15th, 2004. Bonnie might have spread some light rain a day or two earlier, I don't specifically remember, but Charley passed off our coast as a 40 mile per hour tropical storm. I remember this clearly because the most intense wind and rain were far ahead of Charley's center, and when the center was closest, there was no rain or wind to speak of onshore, mostly offshore. Earlier that day, Charley had been a Category One hurricane off of South Carolina, and a day or two before that, a monster Category 4, hitting Punta Gorda, Florida. Later that season, New Jersey got rains from the remnants of Frances, Gaston, Ivan & Jeanne. Jeanne was the strongest, and brought the most intense winds of that season, although Charley was far wetter. I will try to find sources to back this up, but I have followed every New Jersey tropical storm & hurricane since 1976, and work in the Office of Emergency Management. Some of the worst conditions I've ever experienced were during the passage of Tropical Storm Ernesto in 2006, because the wind and rain lasted a long, long time: about two days, with frequent gusts near hurricane force, even over that threshold just south of here..  Floyd, Bertha, Gloria and Belle were  stronger, but they moved faster. My community, Seaside Heights was in the direct center of 70 mph Tropical Storm Floyd in 1999, with a dead calm lasting about an hour, sandwiched between periods very, very wind conditions. Hanna in '08 was the biggest wimp of all these storms: a bit of rain and wind, but mostly hype.\n",

Agreement quite clearly states that if the war came to Baltic Sea then Finns were allowed to place troops to the island. And what do you know... Nazi Germany was at war and used Baltic sea making it legal under the demilitarization treaty for the Finns move troops there (technically they could have kept troops there the whole time - its not Finnish problem if SU cant understand treaty texts). Also there is no requirement for the Finland to participate into that war in order to allowed to place troops in Åland.

And I believe I have the right to express my opinion of such behavior on MY OWN TALK PAGE. The behavior he exhibited was pure paranoia and hysterics as I see it, and others have agreed, and he also is accurately described as someone who continually deleted cited and relevant material from Wikipedia despite mine and others protests, as well as all comments made by him and myself that showed his own incivil behavior. That is why I have reproduced the exchange on my talk page as it has been deleted from where it originally occurred with only my YouTube post left intact. I wonder why he did that? My remark above contains nothing profane and represents my view of his outrageous behavior and was placed nowhere but on MY OWN TALK PAGE. And as far as personal attacks go, I consider his use of the term \"\"Gun Nut\"\" as well as mocking my family name to be such that went unpunished.
